**Authors:** _Ahmet Yilmaz_ (Department of Computer Engineering, Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University) and _Riccardo Poli_ (School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex)

The code in _gp_nn.py_ is for evolving learning rules

The code in _train_with_rules_seeds_and_cross_val.py_ is for testing evolved rules against the standard back propagation algorithms
